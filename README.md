Guess the number is a web-based application/game which I have created using JavaScript, HTML and CSS while learning JavaScript. <br>
I have created the logic this way: <br>
•	Whenever the user launches the application for the first time, he will be allotted a score of 20 and the high score will be set to 0. <br>
•	User has to guess any number between 1 to 20, every time he makes an incorrect guess, a message will be displayed indicating number guessed is too high or low than the secret number. <br>
•	For every incorrect number, user will lose one point from Score (initially set to 20). <br>
•	Once user reaches to a Score of 0, a message will be displayed about losing the game. <br>
•	After that, user a start and play a new game. <br>
•	If user guesses the correct score, the Score will then be set as a High Score. User can play again from this point. <br>
•	The Score will be reset to 20 every time user wants to continue to play, whereas high score will be carried forward and will be updated only if user scores more than high score.
